This repository contains a MATLAB function that demonstrates an uncommon error scenario. The `myFunction` takes an input and performs some calculations. It might throw an error if the input is negative or if the intermediate calculations result in values outside the acceptable range for MATLAB's data types. The solution demonstrates how to handle these cases more robustly, adding checks and potentially using different data types or algorithms to avoid the error.
